                    <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). 
                        I started to think about how I could
                         improve my design skills and attract 
                         more customers. I wanted to start designing 
                         some ideas that for a long time I had only 
                         on paper and stored on my cell phone, I 
                         decided to look for some challenge, something 
                         that makes more sense with what I thought.I 
                         saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) 
                         made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, 
                         but the problem was that the result was just something 
                         nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

                        <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not

                            feedback and learn from it.</p>
